Query Handling System has been introduced as all categories of students cannot clear their doubts
with lecturers or other students at any point of time and place. It provides the best way to clarify
doubts from any place for modest people. From this, we can also know answers of the queries which
cannot be answered by friends or respective lecturers as the queries can be seen by all the people who
registered in that website
The front end is designed mainly using HTML, CSS,javascript, JSP. The backend provides
the storage of the students and lecturers details. The backend tools used are Java and mysql.

Existing System:
The existing system is manual one where the students clear their queries by approaching concerned
faculty or other students. In the existing system, it is difficult to maintain frequently asked questions.
Some students cannot express their doubts because of their nervousness. So to avoid this we proposed
Query Handling System.

Proposed System:
In proposed system, students need not approach faculty or other students directly. One can easily
maintain their frequently asked questions.To use this system, student should create account with their
rollno whereas staff has to create using their idâ€™s.
When student needs to post his/her query, he need to choose the subject in order to maintain clarity
for others. To view answers to his queries he has to choose view option. Student can also answer other
student queries by choosing reply option
